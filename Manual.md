"All good things of this earth flow into the city." (Pericles)

You are a leader of one of the seven greatest cities in Antiquity. Develop your city by increasing your scientific discoveries, military conquests, commercial agreements, and prestigious structures to lead your civilization to glory! All the while, keep an eye on your neighbors' progress since they share similar ambitions. Will your wonder transcend the millennia to come?

## Overview Of The Game

A game plays over 3 rounds, called Ages, during which you simultaneously play cards one by one to develop your City. These cards represent the different Buildings you can construct: resource production, civil, commercial, military, scientific, and guild Buildings.

At the end of each Age, head to war with your two neighbors. At the close of 3 Ages, count your total victory points provided by your City, Wonder, military prowess, and Treasure. The player with the highest score wins the game.

## Day Or Night Side

## Setup

1

Prepare the Age cards:

2

Each player randomly takes a Wonder Board and places it in front of themself, picking their preferred side (

## Day Or

## Night).

Note: For your first few games, we recommend using the Day side of the Wonder

boards. For any following games, feel free to mix Day and Night sides. If you like, you can also choose Wonder boards instead of distributing them randomly.

Take 3 Coins (worth 1) and place them on your Wonder board. These Coins make up your starting Treasure. Place the leftover Coins in the middle of the table to make the Coin reserve.

Place all of the Military Conflict tokens in the middle of the table to make the Military Conflict token reserve.

All other game contents are put back in the box and will not be used during this game.

- Separate the Age cards into three decks: Age I, Age II, and Age III.

- For each Age, sort the cards by the minimum number of players required and keep only the cards with a number less than or equal to the number of players. Put the other cards back in the box, they will not be used during the game.

Example: In a 5-player game, keep all cards with 3+, 4+, and 5+ in each deck of Age cards.

- In the Age III deck, take all the Purple cards. Randomly draw as many cards from these as the number of players +2 and keep them face down. Add these cards to the other Age III cards. Put the other Purple cards back in the box, they will not be used during the game. Example: In a 5-player game, you will randomly draw 7 Purple cards (5 players + 2).

- Shuffle each deck of Age cards and put them face down in the middle of the table.

## Gameplay

A game plays over three successive rounds: Age I, Age II, then Age III. Each round plays in a similar fashion. Victory points are scored at the end of Age III.

## Definitions:

Neighbors: The term "neighbors" refers to the player directly on your left and the player directly on your right. City: The term "City" refers to your developments, which includes your Wonder and constructed cards.

OVERVIEW OF AN AGE At the start of each Age, take the corresponding deck of cards (I, II, or III) and randomly deal 7 cards to each player face down. These cards will make up your starting hand.

Each Age has 6 turns during which you all play simultaneously. A turn is comprised of three stages, which happen in this order:

1. Choose a card 2. Play this card 3. Pass your hand

1. CHOOSE A CARD Take stock of the cards in your hand without showing them to the other players. From these cards, choose 1 and place it face down in front of you. Set the remaining cards aside face down. They will be used later.

2. PLAY THIS CARD When everyone has chosen a card, play them simultaneously. You can use this card to complete one single action from the ones listed below: A. Construct the Building on your card B. Construct a stage of your Wonder C. Sell the card

Note: At the start of your first game, we recommend paying attention to everyone's actions,

B. Construct a stage of your Wonder To construct a stage of your Wonder, pay only the cost shown on your Wonder board for this stage (see Construct in 7 Wonders pages 6-7). Put your card face down under your board so that half is covered by the stage of the Wonder you are constructing. The effect of this stage is now available to you for the rest of the game.

## Cost

playing one after another, to familiarize yourself with the game.

A. Construct the Building on your card To construct the Building on your card, pay any listed costs and place it face up above your Wonder board (see Constructing in 7 Wonders pages 6-7). Once built, the Building will remain in your City until the end of the game.

Important: You can never construct two identical Buildings, meaning no two cards

in your City can have the same name.

CARD PLACEMENT IN YOUR CITY Stack cards of the same color making sure to keep their effects visible and stack resources above your starting resource. (See example on page 8).

Note: You can use any card to construct a Wonder stage and this card has no other use besides

activating the effect of this stage.

Wonder stages can be constructed at any moment during the game. In other words, you can construct the first stage of your Wonder in Age I, II, or III. However, you are required to construct the stages of your Wonder from left to right (stage 1 before stage 2, then stage 2 before stage 3).

Note: Constructing stages of your Wonder is optional.

C. Sell the card To gain Coins, you can sell your card. To do so, discard your card face down in the middle of the table (onto a pile that makes up the discard) and take 3 Coins from the reserve that you add to your Treasure.

3. PASS YOUR HAND When all players have completed their action, take the cards you did not choose and give them to the neighbor on your left (during Ages I and III) or to the neighbor on your right (during Age II). The direction for passing is shown on the back of the Age cards. You will therefore receive a hand of cards from your neighbor. These cards will make up your new hand of cards for the next turn. You will have one fewer cards each turn, and will ultimately have only two on the last turn.

SIXTH AND LAST TURN At the start of the sixth and last turn of each Age, you will receive a hand of 2 cards from your neighbor. Choose 1 of these cards and discard the other face down to the discard pile. The discarded card does not give you any Coins. Play your sixth and last card as normal.

## Continue To The Resolution Of Military Conflicts.

## Resolution Of Military Conflicts

## Each Age Ends With The Resolution Of Military Conflicts.

Count all military symbols board, if any, to determine your military strength. Then compare your total military strength with that of each of your neighbors.

on cards you have constructed and those on your Wonder

For each neighbor: • If your military strengths are equal, neither one of you takes a token. • If your military strength is lower, take a Military Defeat token. • If your military strength is higher, take the Military Victory token that corresponds

Example: At the end of Age II, your military strength is 4. The strength of the neighbor

on your left is 5 and the strength of the one to your right is 2. You suffer a Defeat against the neighbor on your left and therefore take a Military Defeat token. You emerge as the victor of the Conflict against the neighbor on your right and take a Victory token for Age II.

## Neighbor On Your Left

## Your City In Age Ii

## To The Current Age.

## Neighbor On Your Right

## Defeat

## Age I

## Age Ii

## Age Iii

After the Resolution of Conflicts, the current Age ends and you continue to the next Age. After the Resolution of Conflicts in Age III, continue to the End of the game (page 8).

Military strength = 5

Military strength = 4

## Victory

Military strength = 2

## Constructing In 7 Wonders

During the entire game, you will have the option of constructing Buildings or Wonder stages. To do this, you must pay the corresponding construction cost, shown on the cost zone of cards or each of the Wonder stages.

Reminder: You can never construct two identical Buildings, meaning you cannot have

## Two Cards With The Same Name In Your City.

There are different types of costs:

A. No cost B. Coin cost C. Resource cost D. Free cost through chains

A. NO COST If the cost zone is empty, the card is free and requires no resources or Coins to be constructed.

## Cost: 1 Wood

C. RESOURCE COST Certain cards and Wonder stages require one or more resources to be constructed. You can use resources produced by your City and/or buy resources from your neighbors.

Important: Resources used for constructing are never lost and can be used on every turn

## Of The Entire Game.

## Card

## Wonder Stage

## Cost: 2 Ore

## Cost: None

Using resources produced by your City You produce one resource per resource symbol shown in your City: starting resource on your Wonder board, Grey, Brown, and Yellow cards, and certain Wonder stages. Each resource symbol can only be used once per turn.

Example: You produce 2 Stones, 1 Ore, and 1 Papyrus. You can therefore construct

the Barracks since your City produces 1 Ore, or the Scriptorium since your City also produces 1 Papyrus. However, you cannot construct the Guard Tower since you do not produce Clay.

B. COIN COST Certain cards cost 1 Coin. Take 1 Coin from your Treasure and place it in the reserve when constructing the Building on the card.

## Cost: 1 Coin

Buying resources from a neighboring City If your City does not produce the resources needed to construct a card or Wonder stage, check your neighbors' Cities. If they produce the resources you need, you can buy these resources from them.

For each resource bought, give 2 Coins to the owner of the resource. This player keeps their card and can still use the resource you just bought.

Each resource symbol can only be bought once per turn by the same player. Resources must be used on the same turn as they were bought.

Resources you can buy from your neighbors include: • The starting resource on their Wonder board; • Resources on their Brown cards; • Resources on their Grey cards. It is impossible to buy resources produced by their Yellow cards or the stages of their Wonder.

If your neighbor has a card that produces a choice of 1 resource from two resources shown, you can choose which one to buy, regardless of what your neighbor has chosen.

Notes: • To buy resources, you must spend the required Coins at the beginning of your turn.

You cannot use Coins you receive from other players during the same turn.

- You cannot buy resources from a Building your neighbor constructed that same turn. • You can never prevent a player from buying your resources. • Both of your neighbors can buy the same resource from your City.

D. FREE COST THROUGH CHAINS Starting in Age II, certain cards have a free construction condition shown as a chain symbol. If you have previously constructed a card with the same symbol in the upper right corner, you can construct this card for free.

Example: In Age I, if you constructed the Theater in your City, you can construct the Gardens

in Age III for free, since you have the corresponding chain symbol.

## Age I

## Age Iii

## Symbol Of Identical Chain

Notes: • If you do not have the symbol that corresponds to a card's chain, you can still construct

this card by paying its resource cost.

- Certain cards grant access to two chains; in this case, you will see two symbols in the upper right corner of the card.

## End Of The Game

The game ends at the close of Age III, after the Resolution of Military Conflicts. Proceed with counting victory points by using the score pad. The player with the highest score wins the game. If there is a tie, the player with the most Treasure wins. If there is still a tie, all tied players share the victory.
