Welcome to 7 Wonders Duel! 7 Wonders Duel is a game for 2 players in the world of 7 Wonders, the best-selling boardgame. It uses some of the main mechanics of its older brother, but offers a new challenge, especially adapted for one-on-one games.

## Contents

1 Game Board • 23 Age I cards • 23 Age II cards • 20 Age III cards • 7 Guild cards • 12 Wonder cards • 4 Military tokens • 10 Progress tokens • 1 Conflict pawn • 31 coins (14 value 1, 10 value 3 and 7 value 6) • 1 Scorebook • 1 Rule book • 1 Helpsheet

## Overview & Object Of The Game

In 7 Wonders Duel, each player is leading a civilization and will construct Buildings and Wonders. All of the Buildings constructed by a player together with their Wonders are called a "city".

A game plays out over 3 Ages, each Age using one of the 3 decks of cards (first the cards from Age I, then Age II, and finally Age III). Each Age card represents a Building.

These Ages are played out in a similar fashion, with each player having the chance to play approximately 10 cards per Age to earn coins, strengthen their armies, make scientific discoveries, and develop their city.

In 7 Wonders Duel, there are 3 ways to claim victory: military supremacy, scien- tific supremacy, and civilian victory.

Military and scientific victories can happen at any time and end the game immediately. If, by the end of the third Age, no one has yet won the game, the players add up their victory points, and the player with the highest score is declared the winner.

## Game Elements

Wonder card Each large card represents a Wonder from the Age of Antiquity. Each Wonder consists of a name, a construction cost, and an effect.

## Name

## Cost

## Effect

Board The board represents the military rivalry between the two cities. It is divided into zones (9) and spaces (19). The last space on each end represents the player's capital. It also holds the Military tokens and the Progress tokens available for the cur- rent game.

## Progress Tokens

## Military Tokens

## Spaces

Military Tokens The Military tokens represent the benefits a city earns when it manages to gain the upper hand, militarily, over its opponent.

Progress Tokens The progress tokens represent effects which you can obtain by collecting iden- tical pairs of scientific symbols.

## Zones

## Start Location Of The Conflict Pawn

Coins Coins allow you to construct certain Buildings, and to purchase resources through commerce. The Treasury, the accumulated coins, is worth victory points at the end of the game.

Conflict Pawn The Conflict pawn indicates on the board one city's military advantage over the other.

Guild and Age cards In 7 Wonders Duel, all of the Age and Guild cards represent Buildings. The Building cards all consist of a name, an effect and a construction cost.

## Effect

## Cost

Cost of cards The area located under the color strip on Age cards indicates the construction cost. If that area is empty, the Building is free and requires no resources to be constructed. Example: the Lumber Yard is free, the Stone Pit costs 1 coin, the Baths require 1 Stone to be built, and the Arena requires 1 Clay, 1 Stone and 1 Wood.

## Name

There are 7 different types of Buildings, easily identifiable by their colored border.

- Raw materials (brown cards), these Buildings produce resources: • Manufactured goods (grey cards), these Buildings produce resources: • Civilian Buildings (blue cards), these Buildings are worth victory points: • Scientific Buildings (green cards), these Buildings allow you to score victory points and grant a scientific symbol: • Commercial Buildings (yellow cards), these Buildings are worth coins, produce resources, change the trading rules, and are sometimes worth victory points. • Military Buildings (red cards), these Buildings increase your military power: • Guilds (purple cards), these Buildings allow you to score points based on specific criteria.

Note: The Age III deck contains no Raw materials (brown cards) or Manufactured goods (grey cards), but it contains the Guild cards (purple cards).

Starting in Age II, some Buildings have both a cost and a free construction condi- tion: if the player has previously constructed the Building indicated via a symbol in the cost area, the construction is free. Example: the construction of the Horse Breeders requires 1 Clay and 1 Wood, OR the possession of the Stable.

## Preparation

1. Place the board between the two players on one side of the play area. 2. Place the conflict pawn on the neutral space in the middle of the board. 3. Place the 4 Military tokens face up, on their spaces. 4. Shuffle the Progress tokens and place 5 of them randomly, face up, on the board. Return the rest to the box. 5. Each player takes 7 coins from the Bank.

## Wonders Selection Phase

- Choose a first player • Shuffle the 12 Wonders tiles • Place 4 random Wonders, face up, between the two players • The first player chooses 1 Wonder • The second player chooses 2 Wonders • The first player takes the remaining Wonder • Place 4 more Wonders and repeat the selection, but this time, start with the second player.

Once this step is complete, each player will have 4 Wonders for the game, which they place in a column, to the left of their play area.

For your first game, ignore the Wonders Selection phase and take the following Wonders tiles: Player 1:

- the Pyramids • the Great Lighthouse • the Temple of Artemis • the Statue of Zeus

## Player 2:

- Circus Maximus • Piraeus • the Appian Way • the Colossus

One deck per Age Return to the box, without looking at them, 3 cards from each Age deck. Then randomly draw 3 Guild cards and add them to the Age III deck without looking at them. Return the remaining Guilds to the box.

## Constructing In 7 Wonders Duel

Throughout the game, you will construct Buildings and Wonders. Most of the Buildings have a resource cost. Some are free and others have a coin cost. Finally, some have a resource cost but also a free construction condition. The Wonders all have a resource cost. Free Construction Some cards have no cost and can be put into play for free. Example: The construction of the Lumber Yard is free.

If you have in your city all of the resources indicated on the Building, then you can construct that Building. Example: Antoine can construct the Baths (1 Stone) or the Garrison (1 Clay) as his city produces the required resources. However, without trading, he can't build the Apothecary (1 Glass).

Resource Cost Some cards have a resource cost. To construct them, you must produce the corresponding resources AND/OR buy them from the bank via the trading rules. Production A city's resources are produced by its brown cards, its grey cards, some yellow cards, and some Wonders. Example: Antoine produces 1 Stone, 3 Clay, and 1 Papyrus in his city.

Important: resources aren't spent during construction. They can be used each turn, for the entire game. Unless there's an exception, a city's pro- duction is never reduced. Trading Often, you will want to construct a Building or a Wonder, while you're missing one or more required resources. In that case, you can always purchase the miss- ing resources from the bank. The cost of each missing resource varies over the course of the game. It is calculated as follows:

COST = 2 + number of symbols of the same resources produced by the brown and grey cards of the opposing city

Clarifications • Note that the purchasing cost is calculated according to the resources present in your opponent's city, but the purchases are paid to the bank. • There is no limit to the number of resources you may purchase on your turn. • The resources produced by yellow cards and by Wonders aren't factored into trading costs. • Some commercial Buildings (yellow cards) change the trading rules and set the cost of some resources to 1 coin.

Example: Bruno produces 2 Stones with his Quarry. • If Antoine wants to purchase one or more stones, he must pay 4 coins for each. • If Bruno needs a third Stone, he must pay 2 coins, as Antoine doesn't produce any with his brown cards.

Bruno wants to construct the Fortificaitons, which has the following cost: 2 Stone, 1 Clay and 1 Papyrus. He has in his city 2 Stone. He must therefore purchase the missing Clay and Papyrus. As his opponent, Antoine, has 1 Clay in his city, but no Papyrus, Bruno must therefore pay 5 coins to the bank: 3 for the Clay (base 2+1), and 2 for the Papyrus (base 2+0).

## Bruno

## Antoine

Cost in coins Some cards have a cost in coins, which must then be paid to the bank when they are constructed. Example: The construction of the Scriptorium costs 2 coins, the construction of the Stone Pit costs 1 coin.

Cost in coins and in resources Some cards have a cost in coins and in resources. To build these cards, you must pay the coin cost to the bank and must either produce the resources, or get them through trading. Example: Bruno wants to construct the Caravansery, which costs 2 coins, 1 Glass and 1 Papyrus. Bruno must pay 7 coins in all. 2 coins for the card's cost, 3 coins for the Glass (Antoine produces 1), 2 coins for the Papyrus (Antoine does not produce any).

Antoine wants to construct the Aqueduct, which costs 3 Stones. As he produces none, he must pay 12 coins to the bank. That's because Bruno produces 2 Stones with his brown cards, which give a price of 4 coins per Stone (2+2), and Antoine needs 3.

Free construction condition (chains) Some Buildings grant a chain symbol (white). Some Buildings in Ages II and III contain, under their resource cost, a white symbol linked to a Building from a previous Age. If you have the Building containing this symbol in your city, you can construct the new one for free. Example: Antoine has constructed the Baths. During Age II, he can build the Aqueduct for free as the icon is on the Baths.

Bruno has constructed the Palisade. During Age III, he'll be able to build the Fortifications for free.

## Game Overview

A game begins in Age I, continues in Age II, and ends with Age III. In case of a supremacy victory (either military or scientific), the game ends immediately. Overview of an Age

Preparation of the structure At the beginning of each Age, shuffle the corresponding deck, then display the 20 cards according to the structure of the current Age (see Game Aid on the last page of this rulebook). Be careful, some cards are displayed face up, while others should be face down.

After having played your card, you must reveal any cards which may have been hidden and which are now accessible. Note: • Some Wonders allow you to play again. You start your new turn after having revealed the newly accessible cards. • If a player has a replay effect that would allow them to take another turn at the end of an Age (when the structure is empty), the effect is lost. 1. Construct a Building To construct a Building, you pay the cost of the Building and place it in front of yourself. This Building now belongs to your city. As the game progresses, sort your Buildings by color in order to help you read your city.

Game Turn In 7 Wonders Duel, the players each play in turn. The first player begins Age I. On your turn, you must choose an "accessible" card in the card structure and play it. An accessible card is a card which isn't partially covered by other cards. Example: the Baths, the Stone Pit, the Lumber Yard, and the Scriptorium are acces- sible. The other cards are not accessible at the moment.

2. Discard to obtain coins You discard the card and take 2 coins + 1 coin per yellow card in your city from the bank. The money is added to your city's treasury. The discarded cards are placed face-down next to the board. Players are free to consult the discard pile at any point. Example: Bruno discards the Aqueduct. He earns 4 coins as he has in his city the Tavern and the Clay Reserve.

You can play the card you've chosen in one of three different ways:

1. Construct the Building • 2. Discard the card to obtain coins • 3. Construct a Wonder

3. Construct a Wonder You pay the cost of the Wonder (not the one of the Age card), then place your Age card face down partially covered by the Wonder card which is being constructed. The used Age card has no effect, it is simply used to show that the Wonder has been built. Example: Antoine takes an accessible card of his choice to construct the Colossus, which costs 3 Clay and 1 Glass. After having paid the cost of the Colossus (not the card's), he slips it, face down, under the right-side of the Colossus and moves the Conflict pawn 2 spaces.

## End Of An Age

An Age ends when all 20 cards from the structure have been played.

Prepare the next Age's structure.

The player with the weakest military chooses which player begins the next Age. A player has a weaker military if the Conflict pawn is on their side of the board. In a situation where the pawn is in the middle of the board, the player that chooses who begins the next Age is the last active player (meaning whoever played the last card of the previous Age).

7 Wonders, not one more! Only 7 Wonders may be built over the course of the game. As soon as either player constructs the game's 7th Wonder, the last Wonder, which has not yet been built, is immediately returned to the box. Example: Antoine has just constructed the Colossus. 7 Wonders have been built du- ring the game (4 by Bruno, 3 by Antoine). Antoine returns the Pyramids to the box.

## Military

Each shield represented on the military Buildings (red cards) or Wonders allows its owner to immediately move the Conflict pawn one space in the direction of the opposing capital. The Conflict pawn is therefore likely to move back and forth on the track. When the Conflict pawn enters a zone (defined by dotted lines), the active player applies the effect of the corresponding token, then returns it to the box. Example: Antoine constructs the Archery Range, a military Building which has 2 Shields. He immediately moves the Conflict pawn two spaces towards the opposing capital. As he enters in a new zone, he applies the Military token, Bruno discards 2 coins, and then the token is returned to the box.

Military Supremacy If the Conflict pawn reach the space of your opponent's capital, you immedi- ately win the game.

## Science & Progress

There are 7 different scientific symbols in the game.

Each time you gather a pair of identical scientific symbols, you may immediately choose one of the Progress tokens on the game board. That token will be kept in your city until the end of the game. Clarification: the scientific symbols are found on the scientific Buildings (green cards) and on a Progress token. Scientific Supremacy If you gather 6 different scientific symbols, you immediately win the game.

## End Of Game And Victory

A game ends immediately in the case of a military supremacy, a scientific suprem- acy, or at the end of Age III. Civilian Victory If no player has won a victory through supremacy before the end of Age III, the player who has the most victory points wins the game. To determine your total, add:

- Your military victory points (0, 2, 5, or 10 depending on the position of the Conflict pawn). • Victory points from your Buildings (blue, green, yellow, and purple cards). • Victory points from your Wonders. • Your victory points from Progress. • Your city's treasury: each complete set of 3 coins is worth 1 point.

In the case where both players are tied, the player who has the most victory points from their Civilian Buildings (blue cards) wins the game. If this is also a tie, then both players share their victory. Note: a scorebook is present in the box to help you total your points, or keep a record of your memorable games!

## Description Of The Symbols

## Military Token

Looting 2 or 5 coins Your opponent loses 2 or 5 coins depending on the token. They are returned to the bank. Then the token is returned to the box. If your opponent doesn't have enough coins, they lose all of their coins.

Agriculture Immediately take 6 coins from the Bank. The token is worth 4 victory points.

Architecture Any future Wonders built by you will cost 2 fewer resources. At each construction, you are free to choose which resources this rebate affects.

Economy You gain the money spent by your opponent when they trade for resources. Be careful, this is only for the money spent obtaining resources, not for the coins which are part of Building costs. Clarification: the trade discounts of your opponent (Stone Reserve, Wood Reserve, Clay Reserve, and Customs House cards) change the purchase price, but the Economy Progress token allows you to gain the actual money spent by your opponent.

Law This token is worth a scientific symbol.

Masonry Any future blue cards constructed by you will cost 2 fewer resources. At each construction, you are free to choose which resources this rebate affects.

## Progress Token

Mathematics At the end of the game, score 3 victory points for each Progress token in your possession (including itself).

Philosophy The token is worth 7 victory points.

Strategy Once this token enters play, your new military Buildings (red cards) will benefit from 1 extra Shield. Example: a military Building with 2 shields will therefore allow the player to move the Conflict pawn 3 spaces towards the enemy capital. Clarification: • This Progress does not apply to Wonders which have the Shield symbol. • This Progress has no effect on military cards built before it came into play.

Theology All future Wonders constructed by you are all treated as though they have the "Play Again" effect. Be careful, Wonders which already have this effect are not affected (a given Wonder cannot have the "Play Again" effect twice).

## Organization Of The Card Board Depending On The Age

At the beginning of each Age, shuffle the corresponding deck, then lay out the 20 cards according to the structure of the current Age. Be careful, some cards are laid out face up, and others face down. To make things easier, start at the indicated point.
