[rule-clarification-of-progress-token-named-theolog](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2401098/rule-clarification-of-progress-token-named-theolog)

> Help me to understand how theology progress token works in the game?. Does play again means I can construct future wonder twice or thrice?

Theology token give you the “play again” bonus to all your wonders, so it’s useless for wonders that already have it. It basically improves some of the wonders giving it an extra ability.
"Play again" means that you get to take another turn after building a wonder. You don't get to repeat any effects or bonuses from your previous turn.
In addition, theology doesn't add an additional "play again" bonus to a wonder that already has one. It just ensures that every wonder has one (and only one) "play again" bonus. You can find this clarification on page. 14 of the english rules, "description of the symbols"


----
page 14

**Theology**
All future Wonders constructed by you are all treated as though they have the “Play Again” effect.
Be careful, Wonders which already have this effect are not 
affected  (a  given  Wonder  cannot  have  the  “Play  Again”  
effect twice).

----
page 10 
Note: Some Wonders allow you to play again. You start your new turn after having revealed the newly accessible cards.•  If a player has a replay effect that would allow them to take another turn at the end of an Age (when the structure is empty), the effect is lost.

**Traders Guild**

> Do you replace progress (science) tokens with new ones as they are acquired?

You do not replace the green progress tokens as they are collected.
This is not the same as collecting six unique sciences. On the green science cards you will find various symbols. There are seven different symbols. If you collect 6 unique science symbols from these green cards you win automatically. There is overlap between the two with the Law progress token. This counts as a science if you collect it.


----
page 2

**Progress Tokens**
The progress tokens represent effects which you can obtain by collecting identical pairs of scientific symbols.

----
page 5

**SCIENCE & PROGRESS**
There are 7 different scientific symbols in the game.Each time you gather a pair of identical scientific symbols, you may immediately 
choose one of the Progress tokens on the game board. That token will be kept in your city until the end of the game.
Clarification: the scientific symbols are found on the scientific Buildings (green cards) and on a Progress token.

You are correct that they provide 1 resource of the available choices.
When you draft a card, you can build it (and gain the benefits), OR discard for coins OR use it to build a wonder. When you use it to build a wonder you don't get to use the resources or any other benefits it would provide, as you haven't built the card.


----
Page 15

wood / brick / stone
This card produces, each turn, one unit of one of the 3 raw goods represented.
Clarification: This production has no impact on trading costs

----
page 10

**Game Turn**
In 7 Wonders Duel, the players each play in turn. 
The first player begins Age I.
On your turn, you must choose an “accessible” card in the card structure and 
play it. An accessible card is a card which isn’t partially covered by other cards. Example: the Baths, the Stone Pit, the Lumber Yard, and the Scriptorium are acces-sible. The other cards are not accessible at the moment

You can play the card you’ve chosen in one of three different ways
- 1. Construct the Building
- 2. Discard the card to obtain coins
- 3. Construct a Wonder

> What happens when the first military strike is a 3?

You move the military marker 3 spaces towards your opponent. If the marker was at the starting point (middle) and the marker had not previously entered this zone, then your opponent loses 2 coins and you may get 5 VP at the end of the game.


----
Page 14

**Military Token**
Looting 2 or 5 coins
Your opponent loses 2 or 5 coins depending on the token. They are returned to the bank. Then the token is returned to the box. If your opponent doesn’t have enough coins, they lose all of their coins.

----
Page 12

**MILITARY**
Each shield represented on the military Buildings (red cards) or Wonders allows its owner to immediately move the Conflict pawn one space in the direction of the opposing capital. The Conflict pawn is therefore likely to move back and forth on the track. When the Conflict pawn enters a zone (defined by dotted lines), the active player applies the effect of the corresponding token, then returns it to the box
Example: Antoine constructs the Archery Range, a military Building which has  
2 Shields. He immediately moves the Conflict pawn two spaces towards the opposing capital. As he enters in a new zone, he applies the Military token, Bruno discards  2 coins, and then the token is returned to the box.

**Military Supremacy**
If the Conflict pawn reach the space of your opponent’s capital, you immediately win the game.


[urbanism](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1485147/urbanism)

> If I have the Urbanism token, the rules say: each time you construct a building for free through linking (free construction condition, chain), you gain 4 coins. Do I also get the 4 coins if I build a building that doesn't have a cost, like the Drying Room?

No. Free construction condition and chain are the same thing. Some buildings have a Free Construction Condition on them. If you already have the required symbol on another building, then you construct it for free, thus activating a Chain. You get the 4 coins only when you construct a building for free through linking.


----
Page 15

Ubanism:
Immediately take 6 coins from the Bank.
Each time you construct a Building for free through linking (free

Free construction condition (chains)Some Buildings grant a chain symbol (white).Some Buildings in Ages II and III contain, under their resource cost, a white symbol linked to a Building from a previous Age. If you have the Building containing this symbol in your city, you can construct the new one for free.


[coins](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1544878/coins)

[economy-progress-token](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2035041/economy-progress-token)

> Straight from the rulebook: "You gain the money spent by your opponent when they trade for resources. Be careful, this is only for the money spent obtaining resources, not for the coins which are part of Building costs. Clarification: the trade discounts of your opponent (Stone Reserve, Wood Reserve, Clay Reserve, and Customs House cards) change the purchase price, but the Economy Progress token allows youto gain the actual money spent by your opponent" What happens in the following example? Player A has the economy token and is producing two bricks in his city. Player B produces no bricks but has the clay reserve that lets him buy clay for 1 gold each ignoring what his opponent is producing. Would B have to pay A 4 gold for every brick he purchases?

If you have to buy a ressource (be it clay, or bricks or glass or whatever), the money you are spending WILL GO to you opponent (be it 1 gold if you have the reserve or 4 gold if your opponent produce 2).
The ONLY time you'll give gold back to the bank will be if the card you're getting is specifically asking for gold (like when you have to pay 1 gold to get a reserve).

----
page 8

**Trading**
Often, you will want to construct a Building or a Wonder, while you’re missing one or more required resources. 
In that case, you can always purchase the miss-ing resources from the bank. 
Clarifications:
- Note that the purchasing cost is calculated according to the resources present 
in your opponent’s city, but the purchases are paid to the bank. 
- There is no limit to the number of resources you may purchase on your turn.
- The resources produced by yellow cards and by Wonders aren’t factored into 
trading costs.
- Some commercial Buildings (yellow cards) change the trading rules and set the cost of some resources to 1 coin.

----
Page 9

**Cost in coins**
Some cards have a cost in coins, which must then be paid to the bank when they are constructed

**Cost in coins and in resources**
Some cards have a cost in coins and in resources. To build these cards, you must pay the coin cost to the bank and must either produce the resources, or get them through trading.

Do I only pay 1 gold to the bank for each I cannot produce and ignore any stone producing resources my opponent has?

Only grey or brown production cards count for raising the price for the other player.If you need 1 Stone and the other player produce 2 stone on brown cards, you would have to pay 4 Gold (2+2). If you need two stone, you would need to pay 8 Gold.
If you have the yellow building you have a fixed price for 1 Gold for each stone, no matter how much stone the other player produce.

If the card produces stone or wood, I can choose wood for example. The disagreement is about wether or not one is allowed to change the chosen resource the next round. If I chose wood previously, am I allowed in the next round to change to stone and vice versa?

You don't lock yourself into one of the resources. If one thing requires wood you can use it to build that one and then the next time you need the card you can pick a different resource listed on it instead. The restriction is that you can only use one of them each time.

Effect would be: "I can't afford the card.. so you, dear opponent, won't get it either.. even if you can afford."

Think of it this way. Each turn, one card comes out of the display. The active player selects an available card, removes it, and does one of the following:
1) Burns the card for coins. This is your only option if you can't afford 2) and 3).
2) Pays the card's cost and adds it to their empire.
3) Builds one of their four Wonders (paying all costs) and marks the built Wonder with the selected card to show the Wonder is complete.

> If a card like the Trading Post allows me to purchase a resource for 1 coin, is that coin paid to the neighbor or the bank?

The coin is still paid to the bank, not the neighbor. However, the Trading Post does not let you buy resources for a flat 1 coin. Instead, it reduces the base cost of purchasing resources from 2 coins per resource to 1 coin.

If your opponent has resources (e.g., 3 stone cards), the cost to purchase a resource includes an additional cost of 1 coin per resource they have. So, normally, one stone would cost 5 coins (2 base + 3 opponent's resources). With the Trading Post reducing the base cost by 1, the cost would now be 4 coins per stone.

[moneylenders-guild](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2534228/moneylenders-guild)

Yes, the Moneylenders Guild effectively doubles the points from money for its owner. The cardholder scores their own coins normally (1 VP for every 3 coins) and then scores an additional 1 VP for every 3 coins in the richest city (whether it's theirs or their opponent's).

> Does the Moneylenders Guild only provide its bonus if the cardholder has the richest city? 

No, the Moneylenders Guild always provides its bonus to the cardholder, regardless of whether they have the richest city. At the end of the game, you determine which city (yours or your opponent's) has the most coins, and the cardholder gains the bonus VP from that city.

> For cards like the Builders Guild, does the cardholder get the bonus if their city doesn’t fulfill the condition?

Yes, the cardholder always receives the bonus VPs from the guild card they own, even if their opponent’s city fulfills the condition. For example, if Player A owns the Builders Guild and Player B has more Wonders, Player A still scores the bonus VP based on Player B’s Wonders.

> When my opponent has build her 4 wonders, and I haven't build one, do I have to remove one of my wonders immediatly or can I decide later in the game?

The rulebook answers this on page 11:

Quote:
Only 7 Wonders may be built over the course of the game. As soon as either
player constructs the game’s 7th Wonder, the last Wonder, which has not yet been built, is immediately returned to the box.

So if the other player has built all four of their Wonders, you'll be the one to build the seventh Wonder, and the choice will be yours.

The Law token is only used for the 6 different symbols. You cannot have a pair of Law Symbols: there is only one of them among the Progress tokens.

You can choose an accessible card. Accissible means (in 7 Wonders Duel that is ) that the card isn't partialy covered by other cards.

Rulebook page 10, Game turn wrote:
On your turn, you must choose an "accessible" card in the card structure and play it. An accessible card is a card which isn't partially covered by other cards.

Some cards are face down. When they become accessible, they are turned face up, so any you may choose a card all the cards you may choose are face up.

Rulebook page 10, Game turn, top of second column wrote:
After having played your card, you must reveal any cards which may have been hidden and which are now accessible.

The white cards are the cards face up and the colored cards are face down. 
As a reminder: 'The last row, with the accessible cards at the start of an age is always face up.' 

[are-resources-consumed-when-used](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2609219/are-resources-consumed-when-used)

> Are the resources indicated on cards 'consumable' when used? For example: If I have a card resource that produce clay and another that produce wood and suppose that in same turn i want build a wonder that require them plus take a card that also require them can't do both things?

The resources are not consumable in the sense that they get used up and cannot be used for next turn (your next card draft).

The resources shown on a card can only be used once per turn, so if a card has wood and another card has clay, you do not have sufficient resources to play/build a card that requires you to have 2 wood and a clay (you’d have to trade/borrow). You can play/build a card that requires 1 wood and 1 clay, then on a next turn use that 1 wood and/or 1 clay again as needed.

If I have two brown cards that produce stones and a yellow card that produces payrus/glass, I can always built the structure? My resources don't accumulate, right? I mean, if I didn't spend all the stones that I can produce by turn, when my next turn arrives I can't count with the previous stones, right?

Your resources aren't "used up".
Your resources are what you have available for construction per turn.
So if after turn 3 you have two stone and one papyrus, then you can build a card that costs a stone and a papyrus on turn 4, and on turn 5 you can use the same stone and the second stone to build a card that costs 2 stone.

> When in the middle of the game I want to discard a card, can it be one that it was already played? And if it is, if it's ared card with one military symbol, as I am in the middle of the game, should I lose one position in military fight or it continues in the same position?

You can only discard cards for money from the "unused" structure.
You always take a card from the structure and do one of 3 of the following with it: build it and add it to your "civilisation"; bury it under your wonder to build that wonder or discard it for money.

> If on my turn, I don't have enough money for trade or resources to purchase a card then what can I do? Do I pass on my turn? The way I read the rules is that you must purchase an active card before you either build a wonder, add to city, or discard for money. If I have to purchase in order to discard and get money... what happens if i have no money or resources to purchase in the first place?

You don't purchase the Card.

You have 3 options with each card:
1) Purchase and build the Card in your city
2) user the Card to build a Wonder, you don't pay for the Card, but you do pay for the Wonder.
3) Discard the card, receiving 2 (+1 per yellow card you already own) gold

[urbanism-chainning-mandatory](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1569278/urbanism-chainning-mandatory)

> The urbanism science token says: "each time you construct a building for free through linking (free construction condition, chain), you gain 4 coins". This brought some questions, if someone has all the material and the free icon condition, can they pick the method of building?

Yes, you can pick the method of building.

> If they are missing the material but they have the icon for chaining, can they buy the missing material to avoid giving the other player 4 gold? 

To your second question, I think you're misunderstanding the science token. It's only when the player who has the token builds anything through chaining that they gain 4 gold. If the other player builds something for free, then that doesn't affect them.

> Or if you have the free icon condition, it automatically apply?

Also, yes. You would technically be able to buy resources to build something instead of building it for free.

There is no limit to the amount of progress tokens you are allowed to have. Theoretically the maximum you can gain in the base game is 6.

> The rules syas, cards used to pay the construction costs are out of play and placed under the wonder. How does this work for cards with multiple resources, such as a resource card with wood/stone/brick? 

You are misreading this. You pay the construction costs via resources, commodities, and money from your supply, then you place the card you drew from the pyramid under the wonder. You do not put the resource and commodity cards under the wonder. The resources and commodities can be used over and over again throughout the ages of the game. 

> Does it take out just the resource paid or does it take the entire card out of play?

They never run out (although they are limited to a one use per purchase basis).

> What if there are no cards left and you want to build a wonder, for example, during the last age and there are no cards left to place under your Wonder?

Each turn you draft/choose a card from the display. With this card you can build it OR discard it for coins OR put it under your wonder to build it. So, you can only build your wonder IF you have a card to build it.

> 1. When building a wonder do I pay extra in my opponent has those resources?.

Yes, if you need to trade for resources to build a wonder, you pay the premium based on your opponents resources, same as for constructing a building.

2. A card cost 1 brick. I have 2 and my opponent has 1 in front of them. What is the cost to me?

Zero. If you have two brick and the card only costs one, you already have sufficient resources. You only need to pay if you lack the appropriate resources and need to pay for them.

No. You do not pay for cards you are scrapping. You only pay a resource cost on the card if you are constructing the card.

If you need to buy the second wood, the cost is 2 coins + the amount of that resource produced by your opponent's brown/gray cards. So, in this case, if your opponent produces 1 wood, the total cost for the second wood is 3 coins (2 base cost + 1 for the opponent’s wood).

> Confuse about yellow card.

when you buy resouce from bank it cost u 2 + each symbol of that resouce in enemy city
example :
enemy have 3 stone in they city then I will pay 2+3 = 5 gold to the bank.
if I have yellow card (Stone Reserve, Wood Reserve, etc)
 - I pay 3 gold for each stone i want (2 base + 1 becuz of yellow card i have)
 - I pay 1 gold for each stone i want ( yellow card discount every stone to be 1 gold )
which choice is correct ? 

If you have a yellow card like Stone Reserve, it reduces the cost of buying the resource from the bank. So, if you want a stone and your opponent produces it, the base cost is 2 coins + the number of stones in your opponent’s city. The yellow card discounts the stone cost to 1 coin per stone.
