[rule-clarification-of-progress-token-named-theolog](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2401098/rule-clarification-of-progress-token-named-theolog)

> help me to understand how theology progress token works in the game? play again means I can construct future wonder twice or thrice?

Theology token give you the “play again” bonus to all your wonders, so it’s useless for wonders that already have it. It basically improves some of the wonders giving it an extra ability.
"Play again" means that you get to take another turn after building a wonder. You don't get to repeat any effects or bonuses from your previous turn.
In addition, theology doesn't add an additional "play again" bonus to a wonder that already has one. It just ensures that every wonder has one (and only one) "play again" bonus. You can find this clarification on page. 14 of the english rules, "description of the symbols"

> I currently have 2 trade cards in my tableu. On my turn, I choose to build the trade card which effect says to gain 1 gold for every trade card in the city. Do I gain 2 or 3 gold (counting the trade card which i only just recently built)?

Near the bottom of page 15 in the rules:
This card is worth 1 coin for each yellow card (including itself) in your city at the time it is constructed. You'd get 3 coins in your example

[do-you-replace-progress-science-tokens-with-new-on](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1498672/do-you-replace-progress-science-tokens-with-new-on)

>do you replace progress (science) tokens with new ones as they are acquired?

You do not replace the green progress tokens as they are collected.

This is not the same as collecting six unique sciences. On the green science cards you will find various symbols. There are seven different symbols. If you collect 6 unique science symbols from these green cards you win automatically.

There is overlap between the two with the Law progress token. This counts as a science if you collect it

>If I build a yellow building which gives me gold for each building of a specific color, in this example also yellow, does the new building count as well? 

Yes. See the card guide on page 15.
Quote: This card is worth 1 coin for each yellow card (including itself) in your city at the time it is constructed.

[yellow-cards-providing-resources](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2524677/yellow-cards-providing-resources)

> I understand that a yellow card with wood / brick / stone symbols at the top provide 
wood OR a brick OR a stone, etc. but can they be used for buying wonders and if so, do you have to discard them (or stash under the wonder) as you'd discard a gray or brown card?

You are correct that they provide 1 resource of the available choices.

However, I get the feeling you are misunderstanding how building a wonder works.

You only use one card to build a wonder - the ONE card you just drafted and are placing under. This card has never been built and thus what is on there doesn't matter.

However, you can only do this if your other cards provide enough resources (or if you're willing to pay). These cards are NOT discarded. They are not a single resource, they are a "supply" of resources, so they aren't used up.

> What happens when the first military strike is a 3?

You move the military marker 3 spaces towards your opponent. If the marker was at the starting point (middle) and the marker had not previously entered this zone, then your opponent loses 2 coins and you may get 5 VP at the end of the game.

[urbanism](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1485147/urbanism)

> If I have the Urbanism token, the rules say: each time you construct a building for free through linking (free construction condition, chain), you gain 4 coins. Do I also get the 4 coins if I build a building that doesn't have a cost, like the Drying Room?

No. Free construction condition and chain are the same thing. Some buildings have a Free Construction Condition on them. If you already have the required symbol on another building, then you construct it for free, thus activating a Chain. You get the 4 coins only when you construct a building for free through linking.

The card goes facedown and doesn't count for anything; it just shows that the wonder has been completed.


[economy-progress-token](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2035041/economy-progress-token)

>Straight from the rulebook: "You gain the money spent by your opponent when they trade
for resources. Be careful, this is only for the money spent obtaining resources,
not for the coins which are part of Building costs. Clarification: the trade discounts of your opponent (Stone Reserve,
Wood Reserve, Clay Reserve, and Customs House cards) change the purchase price, but the Economy Progress token allows you
to gain the actual money spent by your opponent" What happens in the following example? Player A has the economy token and is producing two bricks in his city. Player B produces no bricks but has the clay reserve that lets him buy clay for 1 gold each ignoring what his opponent is producing. Would B have to pay A 4 gold for every brick he purchases?

If you have to buy a ressource (be it clay, or bricks or glass or whatever), the money you are spending WILL GO to you opponent (be it 1 gold if you have the reserve or 4 gold if your opponent produce 2).
The ONLY time you'll give gold back to the bank will be if the card you're getting is specifically asking for gold (like when you have to pay 1 gold to get a reserve).

Yes

> If paying for a resource you don't have its 2 coins plus a coin for each one of the resource your opponent has - is this only the pure resources of that card or any card with that resource e.g: during later stages where you get cards which say have papyrus or glass etc

brown/grey cards

> Can you only pay for resources you don't have to construct cards into your city or can you do the same for wonders? My fiancée ended up with no stone making facilities and therefore we thought couldn't build 2/4 wonders.
Is that right or could she have paid 2 + amount of stone I had to cover why she needed in that respect?

you can buy resources for whatever use: buildings or wonders.

>Let's say I am trying to build something. I can produce 1 stone and need 2. My opponent has 2 cards which produce 1 stone each. I do not have a yellow card with a stone discount. Is my total cost to purchase the extra stone 2 to the bank + 2 for the two stone resources my opponent has or 2 for the bank + the difference in stone producing resources of 1 gold (I have 1 resource, they can produce 2)?, Same example but now I have a yellow card which reduces the cost to purchase stone to 1 gold. Do I only pay 1 gold to the bank for each I cannot produce and ignore any stone producing resources my opponent has?

Only grey or brown production cards count for raising the price for the other player.If you need 1 Stone and the other player produce 2 stone on brown cards, you would have to pay 4 Gold (2+2). If you need two stone, you would need to pay 8 Gold.
If you have the yellow building you have a fixed price for 1 Gold for each stone, no matter how much stone the other player produce.

It doesn't count as another symbol, it is its own symbol. So you will never pair it with anything to earn another progress token, but it can be one of your six different symbols for a science victory.

Yes, a guild card works just like any other card; you can build it, discard it for coins, or use it to build a wonder. (the three options listed on page 10 of the rulebook)

Whenever the opponent buys resources and pays any money for them, that money goes to you instead of to the bank (where it would normally go).

[yellow-resource-cards-with-two-or-more-resources](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2299549/yellow-resource-cards-with-two-or-more-resources)

>Ended up having a heated discussion about the rules of the yellow cards with 2 and/or 3 resources (for example the Forum). We understand that the card rewards the owner with 1 resource each continuous round.
If the card produces stone or wood, I can choose wood for example. The disagreement is about wether or not one is allowed to change the chosen resource the next round. If I chose wood previously, am I allowed in the next round to change to stone and vice versa?

You don't lock yourself into one of the resources. If one thing requires wood you can use it to build that one and then the next time you need the card you can pick a different resource listed on it instead. The restriction is that you can only use one of them each time.

>I think I played it wrong... I thought you can't discard a card you haven't bought. So, instead, I discarded cards I already owned for getting the money. Is it true that you don't need to pay for the card you dicsard for getting 2 money?
Effect would be: "I can't afford the card.. so you, dear opponent, won't get it either.. even if you can afford."

Think of it this way. Each turn, one card comes out of the display. The active player selects an available card, removes it, and does one of the following:
1) Burns the card for coins. This is your only option if you can't afford 2) and 3).
2) Pays the card's cost and adds it to their empire.
3) Builds one of their four Wonders (paying all costs) and marks the built Wonder with the selected card to show the Wonder is complete.

You only score the points where the marker ends up. Only one player will score military points. Note the word "OR". No mention of multiple scoring for this. (Also see page 13)
